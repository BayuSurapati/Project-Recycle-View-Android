            "Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and snarky \"in-your-face\" attitude. He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted. Scout's Double Jump helps him outmaneuver slower opponents like the Heavy and navigate terrain while dodging oncoming bullets and projectiles. Carrying a Scattergun, Pistol, and Bat, he is an ideal class for aggressive fighting and flanking. Scout excels at \"hit-and-run\" tactics that sap away enemy health as his high mobility allows him to get in, do damage, and escape before being noticed. However, Scout possesses the lowest default health pool (alongside the Engineer, Sniper, and Spy), leaving him vulnerable on the front line. However, this is a fair trade-off given his ability to run in and out of contested hot-spots quickly, enabling him to turn the tide of battle before the enemy team can even take notice.\n" +

The Demoman and Soldier can only replicate this ability when equipping the Pain Train. His speed also makes him ideal for capturing intelligence briefcases.",

                    "Well-balanced and possessing both survivability and mobility, the Soldier is considered one of the most flexible classes in Team Fortress 2. Despite his low ground movement speed, he is capable of using rocket jumps to reach his destination quickly. His large health pool is second only to that of the Heavy, and his wide array of armaments and weaponry allows him to bring whatever weapon or equipment is best suited to the situation at hand.\n" +

                    "The Soldier is well known for his spectacular rocket jump. In defiance of all good sense and judgment, the Soldier can detonate a rocket at his feet and launch himself skyward at the cost of some health (which can be reduced by the Gunboats, or negated altogether with the Rocket Jumper). To rocket jump effectively, the player must fire the rocket at the ground or a wall, then immediately jump and crouch. This ability allows the Soldier to navigate the battlefield by air, appear from unexpected places, and reach areas inaccessible to the Scout's double jump and HYPE jumps. After rocket jumping, the Soldier can remain airborne for longer by deploying the B.A.S.E. Jumper.",

Enemies set on fire suffer from afterburn and take additional damage over time, allowing the Pyro to excel at hit-and-run tactics. Due to the Flamethrower's short range, the Pyro is weaker at longer ranges and relies heavily on ambushing and taking alternate routes to catch opponents off-guard.\n" +

Additionally, the Pyro can use the Homewrecker, the Neon Annihilator, and the Maul to protect an Engineer's buildings from an enemy Spy's Sapper. The Pyro can also use the Detonator or Scorch Shot to Flare jump, and the Thermal Thruster jetpack to fly to places that are normally unreachable to them.\n" +

A master of explosives, the Demoman strategically deals massive amounts of indirect and mid-range splash damage. Armed with his Grenade Launcher and Stickybomb Launcher, the Demoman uses his one good eye and the knowledge of his surrounding environment for well-timed sticky bomb detonations that send enemies skyward, often in many pieces. Should anyone get past his explosive ordinance, however, they will be shocked to learn the Demoman is extremely proficient at melee combat, being one of the deadliest melee users in the game, with a variety of powerful melee unlocks in his arsenal.\n" +

This weapon can inflict huge damage at a very high rate of fire, allowing him to mow down opposing babies, cowards, and teeny-men in mere seconds. Being the slowest class in the game, the Heavy's movement speed is his main weakness. Upon revving up or firing his Minigun, his already unimpressive speed drops down to an even lower amount, making him a very easy target for Snipers and Spies. His sluggish speed makes him more dependent on support from Medics and Engineers to keep him actively in the fight. As a result of his burly stature, he also takes 50% less knockback from most damage sources - excluding Sentry Gun bullets.\n" +

It can also be dropped to provide an instant 50% health boost to his teammates, systematically equal to a medium health kit. However, if the Heavy is not careful, an enemy may pick up the dropped Sandvich for a health boost of their own.",

When the Engineer needs to get his hands dirty, his trio of generic yet capable weapons, along with the assistance of his helpful hardware, make him more than capable of holding his own in a fight. If need be, the Engineer can even pick up and haul constructed buildings to redeploy them in more favorable locations. While usually viewed as a defensive class, the Engineer has a selection of high-tech weapons that allow him to destroy projectiles or to build faster-deploying, less damaging Sentry Guns, which give him great utility at the front lines too. His Teleporters are also a key point to both the offensive and defensive team's success, allowing slower, heavier classes to reach the front-lines quicker.",

Teammates who are already at full health have their health buffed beyond the standard limit, going up to 150% of their base health capacity (with the exception of weapons that have overheal penalties, such as the Fists of Steel and the Quick-Fix). Teammates who have not taken damage recently are healed more rapidly, encouraging other players withdrawals when injured.\n" +

                    "When healing, the Medic gradually fills a unique ÜberCharge bar, which can fill faster if healing injured or not-fully-overhealed teammates. When the ÜberCharge bar is fully charged, the Medic's Medi Gun begins to crackle, accompanied by small electric Team-colored particles at its tip, indicating that he can now deploy a unique charge to benefit his healing target (and himself) for eight seconds. A charge from the Medi Gun offers temporary invulnerability; a charge from the Kritzkrieg grants guaranteed critical hits; the Quick-Fix grants rapid healing, along with immunity to knockback and compression blasts from Pyros; and the Vaccinator grants enhanced damage resistance to a specific damage type (bullets, explosives, and fire).\n" +

The longer a Medic stays out of combat and avoids taking damage, the greater the increments of health he passively heals. An injured Medic begins regenerating health at a rate of 3 health points per second, scaling up over the following ten seconds to a maximum of 6 health per second (this base rate can be positively affected by the Amputator, and negatively affected by the Blutsauger).

He is effective at long range, but weakens with proximity, where he is forced to use his Submachine Gun or his Kukri. As a result, the Sniper tends to perch on higher grounds or in hard-to-see places, where he can easily pin down enemies at chokepoints.\n" +
